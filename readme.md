# Image Editor proof of concept

A proof of concept editor for image upload with basic crop, resize and format
conversion tools.

This is a hand-made PoC showing the desired end goal and compare with the NPM
packages I intend on spiking to see if they can implement this PoC's scope with
their off-the-shelf capabilities.
